# Hints of folding a tesseract

The key of solving this problem is to find the similarity between folding a tesseract and folding a cube. There is an old fiction book Flat Land. It described a 2D world and people living in it. Everything inside this world is two dimensional. People are triangle, rectangular, polygon or circle. They see each other's 1D projection, a corner, a line or a curved line. How would a coder in flat land describe a two dimensional net which can be folded into a cube? He may draw a line on their 1D paper, mark corners, and use dash line to show the edges behind. Or he can make a real 2D model, turn it around and imagine how the edges can't be welded together in flat land, but possible in a 3D universe.

It is very like what we are doing to understand the 3D nets for tesseract. 

Computer codes do not have limitations on 2D networks or 3D networks. Folding them technically can use similar algorithms. But the challenges stay inside ourselves. Turning directions, or folding 90 degree, in a 3D coordinate system is easy to think. It becomes too abstract into the 4D universe. What is challenging the coder in the flat land, does bother us in our 3D world. 

So use a 2D net for 3D cube will help to understand the tesseract. Corners in the 2D nets are edges in the 3D net, while edges in the 2D net are faces in the 3D net. The behaviors of them in a 2D net are similar to the equivalents in a 3D net. 

The 3D nets always have a cube folding into the 4th dimension. This is the hardest part for us. How does this cube connect with other cubes? How does its own position change in the 4th dimension? In the 2D net below, if square D is equivalent to the #74 in the red 3D net, the square F is the cube in the 4th dimension #202. Use the 2D net to understand how the other cubes connect to it. Once you figured it out, folding a 4D net into a 5D cube would not even be hard.
